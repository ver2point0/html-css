<p>Once there was a pizza. He didn't like to be eaten, but somehow ended up less than whole. 
He thought he might fill in his holes with fresh dough; it didn't turn out well.</p>
<p>After being baked to cook the fresh dough, his current flesh became burnt.
He didn't want to scrape it away for fear of acquiring more holes. So, he compromised.
The burnt flesh remained with new toppings, and the newly baked dough was perfect.</p>
